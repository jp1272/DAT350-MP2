# DAT350-MP2
Using a dataset from kaggle I put analyzed and gathered insights. This dataset was on housing prices in New York. I made a memo discussing the differerent insights I made as if I were presenting them to a company board.

The data I used was cleaned and made so the only values are ones that contain a given county. I got rid of all outliers and other pieces of data that made the analyzing more difficult. All the changes to the original dataset can be seen in the code.
